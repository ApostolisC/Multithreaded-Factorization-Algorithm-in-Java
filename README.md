# Multithreaded-Factorization-Algorithm-in-Java
This project implements a multithreaded algorithm for factorizing large numbers using Java's BigInteger class. The algorithm leverages parallel processing to efficiently identify prime factors of a given product, making it suitable for handling very large integers that exceed standard data type limits.
